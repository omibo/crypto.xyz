\chapter{Introduction to Cryptography}
\section{Historical Background}
\begin{definition}
A \emph{cryptosystem} is a pair of algorithms for encryption and decryption.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
The Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions \cite{tex}.
\end{example}

\section{Basic Concepts}
\begin{theorem}
If a cryptosystem is perfectly secure, then the key must be at least as long as the message.
\end{theorem}
